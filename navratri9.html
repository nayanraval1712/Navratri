    <div class="p_1">
      The festival of Navratri is one of the most sacred festivals in India. It
      is a period of joy, happiness and excitement. Every year, devotees from
      all over the country celebrate this festival in different ways. During
      Navratri, we worship the nine forms of Goddess Durga. It begins with the
      worship of Maa Shailaputri and is followed by the worship of the other
      avatars of Goddess Durga. The ninth day of Navratri is dedicated to the
      worship of Maa Siddhidatri. The word Siddhi means supernatural power and
      Dhatri means the awarder. Hence, it is believed that Maa Siddhidatri
      fulfils all divine aspirations. Maa Siddhidatri is known to be the giver
      of perfection. She blesses her devotees with wisdom and grants them
      spiritual knowledge. Maa Siddhidatri is also worshipped by demons and is
      surrounded by all Gods.

          <br />
          The story of Maa Siddhidatri begins at a time when our universe was
          nothing more than a deep void. It was filled with darkness and there
          was no sign of life. This is when Goddess Kushmanda created the
          universe with the radiance of her smile. Maa Kushamnda then went on to
          create the Trimurti of Lord Bramha – the energy of creation, Lord
          Vishnu – the energy of sustenance and Lord Shiva – the energy of
          destruction. Once they were created, Lord Shiva asked Maa Kushmanda to
          bestow him with perfection. So, Maa Kushmanda created another goddess
          who bestowed Lord Shiva with 18 kinds of perfection. These included
          the Ashta Siddhi (8 primary forms of perfection) along with 10
          secondary forms of perfection, described by Lord Krishna. This goddess
          who had the ability to bestow these perfections on Lord Shiva is Maa
          Siddhidatri – the giver of perfection.

          <br />
          Now, Lord Bramha was asked to create the rest of the Universe.
          However, since he required a man and a woman for creation, Lord Bramha
          found this task to be very challenging. He prayed to Maa Siddhidatri
          and asked her to help him. Upon hearing Lord Bramha’s request, Maa
          Siddhidatri converted half of Lord Shiva’s body into a woman’s body.
          Therefore, Lord Shiva is also known as Ardhanarishwar (Ardh - half,
          Nari - woman, Ishwar - refers to Lord Shiva). Lord Bramha was now able
          to create living beings along with the rest of the Universe. So, it
          was Maa Siddhidatri who helped Lord Bramha with the creation of the
          Universe and also bestowed perfection upon Lord Shiva. Maa Siddhidatri
          is depicted as being seated on a lotus or a lion. She has four arms
          and holds a conch shell, a mace, a lotus and a discus in each of these
          hands.
