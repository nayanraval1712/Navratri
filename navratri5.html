    <div class="p_1">
      Navratri is one of the most widely anticipated festivals in India and is
      celebrated all over the country with great devotion and excitement. This
      festival is a celebration of Goddess Durga’s victory over the evil demon
      Mahishasura. It is celebrated over a period of 9 days where devotees
      worship the 9 “avatars” of Goddess Durga. Also, a color is associated with
      each day of Navratri, which makes the celebration even more special and
      interesting. The day signifies divine energy. Maa Shailaputri is
      worshipped on the first day of Navratri, while the second day of this
      auspicious festival is dedicated to Maa Bramhacharini. There is an
      interesting story behind each of these “avatars” of Goddess Durga, which
      explains why they are worshipped on that particular day. The third and
      fourth days of Navratri are dedicated to the worship of Maa Chandraghanta
      and Maa Kushmanda respectively, and the fifth day is dedicated to…

          Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati’s first son, Lord Kartikeya, was also known
          as “Skanda”. Hence, Maa Parvati is often referred to as Skandmata,
          which literally means mother of Kartikeya or Skanda. Maa Skandmata is
          another form of Maa Durga and is believed to protect her devotees,
          just like a mother protects her child from harm. She is a powerful
          goddess whose love and care helped Lord Kartikeya defeat the demon
          Tarkasura. *History and Origin A long time ago, Lord Shiva was married
          to Devi Sati. However, when Sati immolated herself at the Maha Yagna
          organised by her father, Lord Shiva became angry and was left
          devastated. He decided to give up all worldly affairs and immediately
          went off into deep penance. Soon, a demon named Tarakasura started
          creating panic and trouble by attacking the other Gods. Also,
          Tarakasura had a boon that only Lord Shiva or his child could kill
          him. This was a cause of great worry as none of the Gods were able to
          defeat him. So, at the request of all the other Gods, Sage Narada met
          Maa Parvati. He told her everything about her previous life as Devi
          Sati and also told her about the purpose of her current birth. Sage
          Narada explained that Maa Parvati would have an offspring with Lord
          Shiva, who would then go on to defeat the demon Tarakasura.
          <br />
          However, in order to make Lord Shiva realize that she was an
          incarnation of Sati, Maa Parvati had to perform extreme meditation and
          penance (Tapasya). She gave up food, water and performed severe
          penance for over a thousand years. Finally, Lord Shiva took notice of
          her dedication and agreed to marry her. When Lord Shiva’s energy
          combined with Maa Parvati’s, a fiery seed was produced. However, this
          fiery seed was so hot that even Lord Agni, the God of Fire, was unable
          to carry it. He handed it over to Ganga, who then safely carried the
          seed and deposited it in “Saravana”, the “Forest of Reeds”. Here, the
          seed was taken care of by six sisters, who were known as Krittikas
          (mothers). Over a period of time, the fiery seed turned into a baby
          boy. Since, the Krittikas looked after him, this baby boy came to be
          known as Lord Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati. Soon,
          Lord Kartikeya was made the commander-in-chief of the Army of Gods and
          was given special weapons to defeat Tarakasura. Kartikeya then fought
          a fierce battle with Tarakasura and eventually slayed the demon and
          brought peace in the world. Since, Kartikeya was born out of an
          effusing, heated seed, he came to known as Skanda, which means
          “effusing” in Sanskrit. And his mother, Maa Parvati, came to be known
          as Skandmata. Parvati performed penance for Lord Shiva and was
          instrumental in bringing Lord Skanda into this world. Therefore,
          Skandmata is worshipped during Navratri. She is the mother of a
          powerful and gifted child who restored peace and harmony among us.
