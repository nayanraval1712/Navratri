    <div class="p_1">
      Goddess Bramhacharini is one of the mightiest avatars of Maa Durga and is
      believed to be a symbol of peace and tranquility. The other powerful
      avatars of Goddess Durga are Maa Kushmanda, Maa Chandraghanta and Maa
      Siddhiratri. Goddess Bramhacharini is worshipped on the second day of
      Navratri. In this incarnation, she embodies tapa (penance) and is known to
      bless her devotees with happiness and eternal wisdom.

        <br />
        <div class="content_1">
          <br />
          In her previous birth, Goddess Durga sacrificed her life in the Maha
          Yagna of King Daksha. Later, she took birth as the daughter of Himavan
          – the King of Mountains and was named Parvati.As she grew up, Maa
          Parvati resolved to marry Lord Shiva, her husband from her previous
          birth. When her parents got to know about this desire, they strongly
          discouraged her and told her that is not possible. However, Maa
          Parvati was determined to marry Lord Shiva. One day, Sage Narada, the
          son of Lord Bramha, came to visit her. After understanding Maa
          Parvati’s wish, he told her that the only way she could marry Lord
          Shiva was if she followed a path of penance and meditation. Maa
          Parvati accepted Sage Narada’s advice and commenced her journey of
          strong penance and devotion. She even stopped eating food and consumed
          only fruits or flowers. Such was her dedication, that for more than
          100 years, she refused to eat anything else. After this, she only ate
          fallen leaves for more than 3000 years and slept on the forest floor.
          Later, she stopped eating fallen leaves and gave up water as well.
          Eventually, she grew fragile and her body also became extremely weak.
          <br />
          However, she refused to give up and continued her penance for many
          more years. Soon, the news of her dedication and sacrifice spread to
          every corner of the world and reached the Gods as well. Lord Bramha -
          the Creator, heard of Maa Parvati’s penance and appeared before her.
          He was pleased with her devotion and told her that no other person
          could have undergone such difficulties. Lord Bramha blessed Maa
          Parvati and told her that her love for Lord Shiva was truly special
          and pure. With the blessing of Lord Bramha, Maa Parvati now continued
          her penance with even more diligence and determination. Soon, Lord
          Shiva noticed her sacrifice and accepted her as his wife. Due to this
          strong act of dedicated penance and unwavering faith, she earned the
          name Bramhacharini or Tapacharini (someone who follows the path of
          Tapa). Till today, Maa Bramhacharini is worshipped as… Maa
          Bramhacharini is the embodiment of faith, love and sacrifice. She is
          depicted as wearing white clothes and is known to carry a Kamandala -
          utensil to hold holy water – and a rosary in her hands. She teaches
          her devotees to stay determined and focused in difficult situations.
          Also, Maa Bramhacharini blesses her devotees with knowledge, peace,
          strength and prosperity.
