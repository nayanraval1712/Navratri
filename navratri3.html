    <div class="p_1">
      The festival of Navratri signifies a time of celebration and togetherness.
      Apart from being one of the oldest festivals in India, Navratri is also
      celebrated by people all over the country over a period of 9 days. It is a
      sacred festival where devotees express their devotion by praying and
      observing fasts. Goddess Durga, along with her multiple avatars, is
      worshipped over a period of 9 days. The third day of Navratri is signified
      by peace, calm and purity. It is dedicated to Maa Chandraghanta, who is
      also believed to be the Shakti of Lord Shiva. Maa Chandraghanta is also
      referred to as the “married” form of Devi Parvati. She is known to protect
      her devotees from all types of evil spirits and has a half-moon (shaped
      like a temple bell) sitting on her forehead.

          <br />
          IMaa Chandraganta was known as Devi Sati in her previous birth. In
          this incarnation, she was married to Lord Shiva and even sacrificed
          her life when her father insulted him. She was then born again as
          Parvati, the daughter of mountains, and observed severe penance to
          marry Lord Shiva. Due to her continued dedication, she came to be
          known as Maa Bramhacharini and Lord Shiva agreed to marry her. The
          marriage preparations were in full swing and everyone was happy for
          Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati. However, on the day of their marriage,
          Lord Shiva arrived with a huge, but strange marriage procession.
          Ghosts, sages, goblins, ghouls, aghoris and ascetics were all part of
          this unusual marriage procession. Lord Shiva, himself, had multiple
          snakes around his neck and his whole body was smeared with ash.
          Moreover, Lord Shiva had snakes in his hair too, which gave him a
          scary and horrifying look. Maa Parvati’s relatives were left shocked
          upon seeing such a terrifying form of Lord Shiva and almost everyone
          fainted out of pure horror. Maa Parvati got worried and feared that
          her family and Lord Shiva would be highly embarrassed because of this
          situation. So, she immediately transformed herself into a terrorizing
          avatar - Chandraghanta.

          <br />
          This was a frightening sight and she looked as terrifying as Lord
          Shiva. Maa Chandraghanta’s complexion turned golden and she now had
          ten arms. She used her tenth arm to bless her devotees, while the
          other nine arms carried a specific object or weapon. She carried a
          Trishula (Trident) with two hands and a Kamandalu (Watering Pot) in
          another hand. Also, Maa Chandraghanta carried a Gada (Mace), a bow and
          arrow, a sword, a Ghanta (Bell) and a Kamala (Lotus). In this
          terrifying form, Maa Chandraghanta approached Lord Shiva and convinced
          him to take a noble form. Lord Shiva agreed and transformed himself
          into a handsome prince. Also, he was now bedecked with beautiful
          jewels and ornaments. Finally, Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati’s marriage
          took place with all the prayers and rituals. Their marriage was
          celebrated all over the world and is observed till today as Maha
          Shivratri. Maa Chandraghanta’s vehicle is a lion. This avatar of Maa
          Durga shows that she can both - compassionate towards her devotees and
          terrifying towards her enemies. She is known to bless her devotees
          with divine grace and fearlessness. Maa Chandraghanta is one of the
          most powerful forms of Goddess Durga and is also known to offer relief
          from suffering and distress.
