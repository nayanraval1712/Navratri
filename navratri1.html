    <div class="p_1">
      The festival of Navratri begins with the sacred ritual of Ghatastapana,
      which is also believed to invoke Goddess Durga. This day signifies the
      victory of good over evil. Maa Shailaputri is the first form of Maa Durga.
      She is worshipped on this auspicious day followed by Maa Bramhacharini,
      Maa Chandraghanta, Maa Kushmanda and other avatars of Goddess Durga. In
      the Sanskrit language, Shail means mountain and putri means daughter.
      Goddess Shailaputri, the absolute form of Mother Nature, is also known to
      be the daughter of Mountains.

          <br />
          According to Hindu beliefs, Goddess Shailaputri is an incarnation of
          Devi Sati. In this incarnation, she was the daughter of King Daksha
          Prajapati who was the son of Lord Bramha. Devi Sati was married to
          Lord Shiva. However, King Daksha was unhappy with this marriage as he
          did not consider Lord Shiva to be worthy of marrying a girl who
          belongs to an honourable family. The story goes that King Daksha once
          invited all Gods to attend a grand religious congregation (Maha
          Yagna). Since, he was against the marriage of Lord Shiva and Devi
          Sati, he did not invite them. When Devi Sati got to know about this
          Maha Yagna, she decided to attend it. Lord Shiva tried explaining that
          King Daksha did not want them to be present for the Yagna, but Devi
          Sati insisted on attending the ceremony. Lord Shiva understood that
          she longed to go home and allowed her to go for the Yagna. But as soon
          as Devi Sati reached there, she noticed that none of the relatives
          were happy to see her. Apart from her mother, all of Devi Sati’s
          sisters and relatives ridiculed her. King Daksha made some derogatory
          comments about Lord Shiva and also insulted him in front of all the
          Gods. Devi Sati could not bear this insult and immediately jumped into
          the sacrificial fire meant for the Maha Yagna and immolated herself.
          As soon as this news reached Lord Shiva, he grew angry and immediately
          invoked a fearful form – Veerhadra. <br />Lord Shiva proceeded towards
          the Maha Yagna and decapitated King Daksha. Later, Lord Vishnu
          intervened and King Daksha was brought back to life with a goat’s head
          attached to his body. Lord Shiva was still grief-stricken and carried
          Devi Sati’s half-burned corpse on his shoulders. He was unable to part
          with her and wandered endlessly about the world. Lord Vishnu used his
          Sudarshan Chakra to severe Devi Sati’s corpse and parts of her body
          fell at different places. These places came to be known as
          Shakti-Peethas. In her next birth, Devi Sati was born as the daughter
          of the God of Mountains – Himalaya. She was named Shailputri and was
          also known as Parvati in this incarnation. In this incarnation, due to
          her prolonged path of penance, she came to be known as Maa
          Bramhacharini or Goddess Parvati. This time, again, she was married to
          Lord Shiva and had two sons – Ganesha and Kartikeya. Being an avatar
          of Goddess Durga, Maa Shailaputri is worshipped on the first day of
          Navratri. She carries a lotus in one hand, a trident in the other and
          uses a bull (Nandi) as her vehicle. Maa Shailaputri is worshipped with
          great enthusiasm and it is believed that devotees can lead a happy and
          successful life with her blessings.
