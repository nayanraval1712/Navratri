    <div class="p_1">
      Navratri is one of the most popular festivals in India and it is
      celebrated every year with great enthusiasm and devotion. Although the
      type of celebration varies in different states, Navratri remains one of
      the most important festivals in Hindu tradition. Celebrated in some states
      as the victory of Lord Rama over Ravana, Navratri is also known as Durga
      Puja in most of the north-eastern states. Here, devotees worship the nine
      forms of Goddess Durga and celebrate her victory over the demon
      Mahishasura. The festival of Navratri begins with the worship of Maa
      Shailaputri and is followed by the worship of Maa Bramhacharini on the
      second day. Maa Chandraghanta is worshipped on the third day, while the
      fourth day of Navratri is dedicated to… Also referred to as the “Smiling
      Goddess”, Maa Kushmanda is worshipped on the fourth day of Navratri. This
      is day signifies passion, anger and auspiciousness. Maa Kushmanda is a
      happy manifestation of Maa Durga and it is also believed that she is the
      creator of the entire Universe. This is reflected in her name as well. The
      first word of her name is “Ku” which means little. The next word “Ushma”
      means energy or warmth and the third word, “Anda”, means egg. So, her name
      suggests that she is the creator of this “little cosmic egg”, that we call
      our Universe.

        <br />
        <div class="content_1">
          <br />
          Maa Kushamanda’s story begins at a time when there was nothing. The
          entire Universe was empty, there was no sign of life and darkness
          prevailed everywhere. Suddenly, a ray of divine light appeared and
          slowly illuminated everything. Initially, this divine light was
          formless and had no particular shape. However, soon it started taking
          a clear size and finally it took the form of a Lady. This divine lady,
          the first being of the Universe, was Maa Kushmanda. It is believed
          that Maa Kushmanda was able to create this Universe with her silent
          smile. She produced this “little cosmic egg” and her smile took over
          the darkness. Maa Kushmanda replaced it with light and gave new life
          to this Universe. Soon, she created the Sun, the planets, the stars
          and the galaxies that fill our night sky. She seated herself at the
          centre of the Sun and is now believed to be the source of all energy
          in our Universe. She provides life to all living beings through the
          sun rays and is therefore, also known as Shakti. After this, Maa
          Kushmanda created three divine goddesses, who were also the first
          beings of our Universe. She used the central eye on her forehead to
          create a terrorizing form – “Mahalakshmi”. The second form was created
          from her left eye and was named “Mahakali”. Finally, she used her
          right eye to create “Mahasaraswati”, a smiling and gracious form.

          <br />
          Later, the body of Mahakali gave birth to a male and a female. The
          male was named Shiva and the female was named Saraswati. Similarly,
          Mahalakshmi also gave birth to a male – Bramha - and female – Lakshmi.
          aa Kushmanda then glanced at Mahasaraswati, who then gave birth to a
          male and female as well. The male was named Vishnu and the female was
          named Shakti. After this, Maa Kushmanda offered Sarwaswati to Bramha,
          Lakshmi to Vishnu and Shakti to Shiva as companions. Later, Maa
          Kushmanda absorbed the three divine goddesses within herself and then
          entered Shakti as an object of divine, powerful and unending energy.
          Maa Kushmanda is believed to be a form of Shakti and is known as the
          one who created this Universe. She was the one who drove away the
          darkness and created the three divine goddesses and other gods as
          well. She rides a tiger and has a total of 8 arms. Each of these arms
          holds a particular object or weapon. She is usually depicted as
          holding a bow and arrow, a lotus, a mace, a pot of nectar, a rosary, a
          disc and a Kamandalu (Watering Pot). Maa Kushmanda is a divine,
          eternal being and is the source of all energy. She is known to bless
          her devotees with strength, wisdom, prosperity and protects them from
          the troubles and hardships of life.
