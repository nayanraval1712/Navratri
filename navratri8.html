    <div class="p_1">
      Navratri is one of the most important festivals in Hindu tradition and is
      celebrated over a period of 9 nights and 10 days. Although the northern
      and western parts of the country refer to the celebrations as Dussehra, it
      is also known as Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Here, each day of
      the festival is dedicated to the nine forms or avatars of Goddess Durga.
      The festival of Navratri begins with the worship of Maa Shailaputri and is
      followed by the worship of Maa Chandraghanta, Maa Kushmanda, Maa Katyayani
      and the other avatars of Goddess Durga. The eighth day of Navratri is
      dedicated to the worship of Maa Mahagauri. The word Maha means great and
      the word Gauri means radiant or fair, hence the name Mahagauri She is
      compassionate, caring and is known to fulfil the deepest desires of all
      her devotees. It is also believed that Maa Mahagauri offers relief from
      all kinds of pain and suffering.

          <br />
          A long time ago, Lord Shiva went into deep penance and meditation due
          to the death of his first companion - Devi Sati. Lord Shiva refused to
          come out of his meditation and stayed away from all worldly affairs
          for many years. Meanwhile, a demon by the name of Tarakasura was
          troubling the Gods to no end. At the request of the Gods, Devi Sati
          was reborn as Maa Shailaputri, the daughter of the Himalayas. She was
          also called as Maa Parvati. It was said that she would bring Lord
          Shiva out of his meditation and their child would go on kill
          Tarakasura. One day, Sage Narada arrived at Maa Parvati’s doorstep and
          told her everything about her previous birth. He also told her that
          she would have to perform severe Tapasya (penance), so that Lord Shiva
          can know her truth. Maa Parvati agreed and gave up all the comforts
          and luxuries of her palace. Soon, she went into a forest and began her
          dedicated penance. Thousands of years passed but Maa Parvati did not
          give up. She refused to eat or drink anything, while also fighting
          through the cold, the rains and the storms. Due to this, her skin
          turned dark and her body was now covered with dust, soil, leaves, etc.
          She turned extremely pale and thin. Due to this severe Tapasya, Maa
          Parvati lost all her radiance and became extremely weak. Finally,
          after a long time, Lord Shiva took notice of her penance. He even
          tested her devotion and realized that she was indeed his Sati, from
          the previous birth.

          <br />
          Lord Shiva agreed to marry Maa Parvati. Since, she had become weak and
          was covered in all kinds of dirt, Lord Shiva decided to cleanse her.
          He allowed the holy waters of Ganga flowing through his hair, to fall
          onto Maa Parvati. This sacred water washed away all the dirt from Maa
          Parvati’s body and she was able to regain her lost radiance. Due to
          her glow and extreme radiance, Maa Parvati came to be known as
          Mahagauri. She wears white clothes, rides a white-coloured bull and
          has four arms. She holds a Trishul (trident), a lotus and a drum in
          each of her hands, while she uses her fourth hand to bless all her
          devotees. Maa Mahagauri represents the purity and inner beauty of
          every living being. She is a loving Goddess who takes care of her
          devotees and helps them overcome their difficulties as well.

        Go for a floral-themed outfit with floral prints or embroidered flowers
        on your attire. This theme can be especially suitable for the springtime
        Navratri celebrations.<br />
        Choose to wear a bright dress with flowers or a pastel coloured print
        but make sure to pair them with right accessories for dresses in order
        to get a timeless piece.<br />
        Neutrals such as black, white, grey, ivory and beige are another styling
        option when you don't have to wear a lot of colours, particularly those
        found in the actual print. It's also a “safe” styling method when you
        aren't quite sure of what to wear, but would like to add florals to your
        wardrobe.<br />
        Simply add a long-sleeve shirt for another layer of warmth and style. Go
        with a pair of white sneakers instead of heels if things are feeling a
        little more casual. But whether it's platform sandals or sneakers, a
        mini floral print dress can be styled with different types of shoes for
        the perfect fitting ensemble
