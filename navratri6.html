    <div class="p_1">
      The festival of “Nine Nights” is upon us and the preparations are in full
      swing. Navratri is indeed one of the most popular festivals of India and
      holds a special place in the hearts of millions of devotees. Every year,
      Navratri is celebrated all over the country with great excitement. Many
      states celebrate the victory of Lord Rama over Ravana, while other
      north-eastern states worship the nine forms or avatarsof Goddess Durga.
      Navratri begins with the worship of Maa Shailaputri and is followed by the
      worship of other avatars like Maa Bramhacharini, Maa Chandraghanta and Maa
      Skandmata. Each of these avatars signifies different qualities of Goddess
      Durga such as affection, love, compassion and wisdom. The sixth day of
      Navratri is dedicated to the worship of Maa Katyayani and signifies
      cheerfulness and joy. Believed to be the destroyer of all evil, she is
      seen as a warrior goddess who was able to bring peace to the world. Maa
      Katyayani is one of the fiercest forms of Goddess Durga. She is also known
      as Mahishasurmardini (Killer of Mahishasura), as she was able to defeat
      and kill the evil demon Mahishasura.

        <br />
        <div class="content_1">
          <br />
          It is told that long ago there was a sage by the name of Katyayana. He
          was a huge devotee of Goddess Shakti and spent days and nights in
          prayer. Sage Katyayana always wished for Goddess Shakti be born as his
          daughter. During this period, an evil demon named Mahishasura was
          creating great trouble for the Gods. As the days went by, he gained
          more power and the Gods were increasingly worried about him. They
          prayed to Goddess Shakti and asked her to save them from the wrath of
          Mahishasura. Goddess Shakti decided to take birth on Earth and end the
          reign of Mahishasura. She granted the wish of Sage Katyayana and was
          born on Earth as his daughter. She grew up to be a strong, beautiful
          fighter and came to be known as Katyayani, the daughter of Katyayana.
          One day, two messengers of Mahishasura - Chandha and Mundha - saw
          Katyayani and were mesmerized by her beauty. They went back to their
          master and told him all about Katyayani Upon hearing this, Mahishasura
          got very happy and immediately asked another of his messenger -
          Dundubhi - to go and talk to Katyayani.Dundubhi met Katyayani and told
          her all about Mahishasura. He told her about his greatness and boasted
          about how Mahishasura was the now the ruler of all three worlds. He
          told Katyayani that she should marry Mahishasura as they would make a
          great couple.

          <br />
          Katyayani smiled and told Dundubhi that according to her family
          tradition, Mahishasura must first defeat her in battle. Only then can
          they both get married. Dundubhi went back to Mahishaura and told him
          about this challenge. Mahishasura agreed and soon the preparations
          began. A fierce battle took place between Katyayani and Mahishasura.
          She managed to defeat his demon soldiers and even killed most of them.
          When Katyayani and Mahishasura came face to face, he transformed
          himself into a buffalo. This proved to be a real challenge for
          Katyayani as she struggled to fight him. However, Katyayani tricked
          Mahishasura and climbed onto his back. He was surprised by this move
          and tried very hard to shake her off, but failed. Katyayani then
          placed her foot on the back of Mahishasura’s neck, pierced him with
          her Trishul (trident) and cut his head off. This is how Maa Katyayani
          killed the evil and powerful demon Mahishasura. In doing so, she saved
          the Gods from his menace and brought peace back into this world.
          Since, Maa Katyayani defeated and killed Mahishasura, she is also
          known as Mahishasurmardini. In many parts of India, unmarried girls
          often observe fasts and pray to Maa Katyayani in order to get a loving
          and caring husband. She is an incarnation of Goddess Durga and is
          depicted as having four hands. She holds a lotus in two hands, a sword
          in one and blesses her devotees with the fourth hand. It is believed
          that she protects her devotees from all kinds of evil and blesses them
          with happiness and joy.
