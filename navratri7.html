    <div class="p_1">
      Navratri is a festival of joy, happiness and devotion. Celebrated over a
      period of nine days, Navratri is also one of the most anticipated
      festivals as people worship the divine goddess Durga. Each day is
      dedicated to a particular form or avatar of Goddess Durga. The first day
      of Navratri is dedicated to the worship of Maa Shailaputri and is followed
      by the worship of Maa Bramhacharini and Maa Chandraghanta. Maa Kushmanda
      is worshipped on the fourth day of Navratri and Maa Skandmata is
      worshipped on the fifth day. The sixth day is dedicated to Maa Katyayani,
      the daughter of Sage Katyayana, while the seventh day of Navratri is
      dedicated to… Maa Kaalratri is one of the terrifying forms of Goddess
      Durga and is also referred to as Maa Kaali. The word Kaal usually refers
      to time or death and the word Ratri means night. Hence, she is also known
      as the Goddess who brings an end to darkness.

          <br />
          Once upon a time, there were two wicked demons by the name of Shumbha
          and Nishumbha. Their brother, Namuchi was killed by the God of Heaven
          – Indra Deva. They both were devasted by this news and decided to take
          revenge upon the Gods. Soon, they launched a fierce attack on the Gods
          and managed to defeat them. They were helped in this attack by
          Chandha, Mundha and Raktabeej. These three were old friends of the
          demon Mahishasura, before he was killed by Maa Katyayani. Together,
          all of them began to rule over the three worlds. Indra and the other
          Gods went to the Himalayas and prayed to Goddess Parvati. She
          understood their fears and created another goddess - Chandi - to help
          them. Goddess Chandi was able to kill most of the demons sent by
          Shumbha and Nishumbha However, demons like Chandha, Mundha and
          Raktabeej were too powerful and she was unable to kill them. So,
          Goddess Chandi created another goddess from her forehead, who came to
          be known as Kaalratri or Kaali. Maa Kaalratri fought Chandha and
          Mundha and eventually killed them. Hence, she is also known as
          Chamunda. After this, Goddess Chandi and Goddess Kaalratri went on to
          fight the powerful demon Raktabeej. Raktabeej possessed a special boon
          from Lord Bramha that if any drop of his blood fell to the ground,
          another lookalike of him would be created from that drop. So, as Maa
          Kaalratri fought and injured Raktabeej, several clones of him were
          being created.

          <br />
          Looking at this, Maa Kaalratri got immensely furious and started
          drinking the blood of every clone of Raktabeej. This prevented his
          blood from falling to the ground and eventually he was killed by Maa
          Kaalratri. Later, she also killed Shumbha and Nishumbha and brought
          peace back to the three worlds. Maa Kaalratri is worshipped on the
          seventh day of Navratri. She is a ferocious manifestation of Goddess
          Durga and is feared by all demons and evil spirits. She is known to
          have a very dark complexion and has long, untied hair. Maa Kaalratri
          is drenched in blood, wears a garland of skulls around her neck and
          has four hands. She holds a thunderbolt and a scimitar in two of her
          hands, while her other two hands are in the abhaya (protecting) and
          varada (blessing) positions. Therefore, it is believed that Maa
          Kaalratri blesses her devotees and also protects them from all evil.
          She is worshipped and honoured during Navratri, as she can destroy all
          darkness and bring peace to the world.

        Make your jewelry the highlight of your outfit. Wear traditional jewelry
        pieces like kundan necklaces, jhumkas, and bangles to complement your
        attire..<br />
        Traditional Indian jewellery is typically made of gold, silver, or other
        precious metals and adorned with precious and semi-precious stones such
        as diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls. The traditional designs of
        Indian jewellery are typically very ornate, with heavy layers and
        intricate details.<br />
        You can choose jewellery that really makes a statement to bring a simple
        outfit to life or do some mixing and matching of jewellery for a more
        layered look. But if you're wearing bold clothing, then often it's a
        good idea to go with smaller, more subtle jewellery pieces as
        highlights.Jewelry helps to express your personal style and to enhance
        your look. Jewelry can also be worn as a fashion statement. It can dress
        up a simple outfit or appeal to a certain audience..<br />
